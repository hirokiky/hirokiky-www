About me
========

I'm Hiroki KIYOHARA, a Happy hacking programmer.
A guy who loves programming and creating something.

Especially I like programming with Python and creating Web applications.
Django is a great Web framework in Python, but Pyramid is great too.
so I often use which one of the two.
If you want to check my pretty source codes, refer :doc:`projects` or :ref:`repositories`.
Or you can meet up me at some Sprint or Hack-a-thon events, maybe, I'll show you my development
environments and my source codes.

The motivation for programming of mine originated an essay.
I've been strongly influenced a essay by Eric S Raymond -
`How To Become A Hacker <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>`_.
I read this essay at the age of fourteen or higher and decided to become grateful hacker.
I was born in 1991, so it's around 2005.

If you are interested in me, please contact me. I'll be glad.
